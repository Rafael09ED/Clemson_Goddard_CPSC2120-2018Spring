<u><font size=+1>CPSC 212  Mystery Orders Lab</font></u></h3></center>

<p>In this lab you will measure the run times of five different
programs and estimate their time complexities. 

<p>
To speed up things, the executable just returns a number
stating the 'time' it takes. 
Copy the java class file 
<tt>TimeSink.class</tt>. It takes two arguments: a number
between 1 and 5, and a value for N. For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>java TimeSink 3 55</pre>
</blockquote>
There is a
built-in 'time limit' so that the program will 'abort'
for values that are too large.

<ol>
<li>
Create a table with times for each program, say with
values of N being 4, 6, 10, 20 50, 100, 200.
Fill in most of the table. 

<p>
<li>
Determine the time complexity of each
program. Give brief justification.
</ol>

<h3>
<font size=+1>Hints for determining the complexity of a program</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>
The complexities have been chosen from the following list of functions
of N:
<tt>constant</tt>,
<tt>log N</tt>,
<tt>N</tt>,
<tt>N log N</tt>,
<tt>N^2</tt>,
<tt>N^3</tt>,
<tt>2^N</tt>,
<tt>fibonacci(N)</tt>,
<tt>factorial(N)</tt></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Using a graphing application to plot the data points might help.
</li>

<li>
Note that time measurements
will vary slightly from one run to the next.
You might average a few runs with
the same input.</li>

<li>
As you look for a pattern, look at the larger times first.</li>

<li>
In each program, there is a certain amount of overhead built in. This overhead
is the same regardless of the input parameter. You might want to subtract
the shortest run time from the other runs to try to eliminate this.</li>

<li>
If necessary, run the program for a few of the intermediate 
numbers.</li>
</ul>
